# Hybrid-Spacecraft-
Optimal performance craft 
the term hybrid is a utilization of combining two or more as much different systems .As we all are aware of today's options from standard fuels operated engines to engines combined with electric to fully electric  
yes I'm using cars and buses as the example 
to lead to Spacecrafts since they share common things and the process  
Wernher Von Braun is the father of the liquid propellant stage of Rockets and ever since absolutely no one has ventured to improve or rework it . 
I'm here to change this with the creator's help of course  
He left us clues and we haven't picked up the pieces until I did .
it all began with the Orion project and him signing on this particular job , but why ? He saw something and it was documented many times 
external pulse detonation propulsion and I turned that into internal pulse detonation propulsion by using many different types of engines to the metals required and obviously 3D printing because it wouldn't work unless it takes on this format .
The term Free Energy Transfer will bring down flight times to distant locations such as the Moon to Mars or even further than that . 
63hrs is the time to beat to the Moon established over 50 years ago  
My aim is under 24hrs non Nuclear but using fuel ,oxidation with plasma ignition that delivers a boost while also using F.E.T as part of the equation on a vacuum drive that has taken the challenge left to us by President Kennedy's HARD speech  
Escaping Earth's Gravity Directly  
care to learn how ? give me a contract and with that being said I only start at safety first protocols and end with safety first protocols no exceptions  
that's my golden rule for humanity and a multiplanetary society ![IMG_20240316_091215](https://github.com/Dorion89/Hybrid-Spacecraft-/assets/163781907/c2b717ca-2229-436a-9d58-d748cab68a8e)
